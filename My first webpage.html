        <p>In HTML documents, tags define the start and end of headings, paragraphs, lists, character highlighting and links. Most HTML elements are identified in a document as a start tag, which gives the element name and attributes, followed by the content, followed by the end tag. Start tags are delimited by < and >, and end tags are delimited by </ and >. For example:

            <H1>This is a Heading</H1>
            <P>This is a paragraph.
        Some elements appear as just a start tag. For example, to create a line break, you use <BR>. Additionally, the end tags of some other elements (e.g. P, LI, DT, DD) can be omitted as the position of the end tag is clearly implied by the context.
        
        The content of an element is a sequence of characters and nested elements. Some elements, such as anchors, cannot be nested. Anchors and character highlighting may be put inside other constructs. The content model for a tag defines the syntax permitted for the content.</p>
